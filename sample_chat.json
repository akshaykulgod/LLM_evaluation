"assistant_reply": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, where each example has an input and a target label. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data using clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques. Supervised methods include logistic regression and random forests; unsupervised include k-means and PCA. Supervised models often require more labeled examples and are used for prediction, while unsupervised are used for exploration.",
